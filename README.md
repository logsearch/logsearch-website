## Quick Start

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build the site - make sure you have it installed first. Next, you can clone and
this repo, run some setup scripts, and start Jekyll:

    $ git clone https://github.com/logsearch/logsearch-website.git
    $ cd logsearch-website
    $ ./bin/reload-upstream
    $ ./bin/run-dev

Now you should be able to point your browser to [`$LOCAL_IP:4000`](http://$LOCAL_IP:4000/). - the exact IP is displayed in the terminal.

To learn more, read our [detailed documentation](./docs/website/).
